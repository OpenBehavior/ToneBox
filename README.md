# ToneBox

A system for high-throughput operant conditioning in a mouse homecage.

Designed by Nikolas Francis (Pkanold@umd.edu)

Francis et al. developed and shared a user-friendly automated system for training up to hundreds of mice in an auditory behavioral task. This system features a custom Matlab GUI running on a desktop that connects to a Raspberry Pi to administer auditory stimuli from a USB soundcard and collects data auditory data, as well as licking data from a water spout with commercially available capacitive sensors.
